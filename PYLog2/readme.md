# pylog2

A simple yet effective logging solution that doesnt require `import logging`!
A modified version with more understandable definitions.

# Installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/9u3/pylog/PYLog2`

# Usage

```python
from PYLog2 import PYLog # Do this unless you want PYLog.PYLog.log

from PYLog2 import Colors, Strings # This is for diagnostic purposes mainly.

# In Strings._all and Colors._all you will see one for [LOG], This is the generic one.

PYLog.info("what") # The log.
PYLog.error("what")
PYLog.warn("what")
PYLog.success("what")
PYLog.generic("what")
```

# Note from Nox.

I thank you all for using my modules, It really means a lot to me. You don't understand.
The time and effort I put into making these for people to use is extreme, And I almost get no users in return..
So if you could just credit me if you use this module, I would really appreciate it!

You can use this for credits:
```python

I'll say it again. Thank you.
